# ContentService

Content service is an API interface for manipulating content.  Specifically `ContentService` works with the `IContent` class.

>Please do not use `ContentService` for simple reads or getting of node content.  Please use the `IPublishedContent` mechanisms for that.

`ContentService` is best used to create, move, sort, update backoffice data programmatically.

Please see a simple demonstration in the [IContent Section](/Chapter%2004%20-%20Get%20and%20Set%20Content%20Programattically%20in%20Umbraco/02%20-%20IContent.md).
