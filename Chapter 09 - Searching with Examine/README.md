Umbraco comes with a built-in search index powered by [Examine](https://github.com/Shazwazza/Examine) that can search both the backoffice and frontend.  Umbraco Examine implements the Examine interfaces for indexing and searching Umbraco content with Lucene.NET.  Lucene.Net is a .NET port of the [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) search and indexing library from the Apache Foundation. 

In a few short steps, you can have a search up and running.
