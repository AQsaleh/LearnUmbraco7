# UmbracoSettings.config

This file handles some of the internal plumbing in Umbraco but many items are still kept in the [web.config](/z-Appendix D - Config Files/01 - Web.Config.md).

Many optional items are not in the file so you should consult the official Umbraco documentation for more information.  Updates to this file is rarely needed on most installs.
