# Azure Blob Storage Provider
## By Dirk Seefeld

### What is it?
This package allows Umbraco to change it's local file system to Azure Blob Storage.

### Why should I use it?
This package allows a developer to abstract media to a third party storage mechanism to keep things in sync when swapping Azure slots.

Be sure to read about an Azure case-study [here](/Chapter%2020%20-%20Azure/README.md).

### Where do I get it?

**Our Umbraco:** https://our.umbraco.org/projects/backoffice-extensions/azure-blob-storage-provider

**NuGet:** https://www.nuget.org/packages/UmbracoAzureBlobStorageProvider
