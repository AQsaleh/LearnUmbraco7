#More Than Property Editors#
AngularJs is used for more than just property editors.  You can use the manifest file to register javascript for custom trees, sections and context menus items as well.

Make sure to checkout the special section on [Custom Sections, Trees and Actions](/Chapter 16 - Custom Sections, Trees and Actions).
