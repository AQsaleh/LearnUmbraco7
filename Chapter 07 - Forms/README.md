#Overview#

Forms can be done manually via the usual MVC patterns or you can take advantage of the `Forms Section` that ships with Umbraco.  

The Forms Section that comes built-in Umbraco is GUI based and is highly extensible.  You will need a license, but it provides an incredible code-free form experience.  For more information, please consult the the official Umbraco documentation.
