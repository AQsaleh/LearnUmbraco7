Umbraco provides a few different ways to route requests to the proper content.  There are three main mechanisms you should be familiar with:

* Request Pipeline - The system that maps the tree structure to a URL is usually just fine out of the box, but Umbraco allows you to fiddle with how the URL's are generated and routed to content.
* Alternate Templates - Umbraco allows content to be retrieved with any template if you append the name of the template.
* [UrlRewriting.config](/z-Appendix%20D%20-%20Config%20Files/02%20-%20UrlRewriting.config.md) - A simple way to rewrite content.

We'll briefly cover the first two in the next couple sections.  For more on UrlRewriting, use the link above.
