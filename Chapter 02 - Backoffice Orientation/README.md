The Umbraco backoffice is where the content editors and developers will spend a large part of their time.  The backoffice is broken into several sections:

* [Content](01%20-%20Content%20Section.md)
* [Media](02%20-%20Media%20Section.md)
* [Settings](03%20-%20Settings%20Section.md)
* [Developer](04%20-%20Developer%20Section.md)
* [Users](05%20-%20Users%20Section.md)
* [Members](06%20-%20Members%20Section.md)
* [Forms (New%20for%20Umbraco%207)](07%20-%20Forms%20Section.md)
* And even custom sections can be created like Umbraco Bookshelf

Version 7 has brought a very clean responsive interface powered by AngularJs.  Umbraco sections (called `applications` when developing new sections) consist of a node tree on the left, a contextual panel on the right and dashboards available at the root of each section.

>NOTE: Typically editors are only given access to the `Content` and `Media` section while developers will need access to everything.
